# Remember Minimap Setting

Adds a setting for showing or hiding the minimap.

For example:

```
    "show_minimap": false
```

This keeps you from having to turn off the Minimap on launch (if you normally do that).
The Minimap can still be toggled with the Command Palette's "Toggle Minimap".

It can be applied to specific langagues, or globally.
